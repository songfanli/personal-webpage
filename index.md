## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Mo Li](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lim/). I am fortunate to receive guidance from Prof. Mo Li both at HKUST and previously at NTU (as a research fellow from July 2023 to October 2023 and as a visiting student from May 2021 to September 2022). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)), where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Li Lu](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/12001.htm). For more information, please refer to my CV.
