## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at HKUST, under the supervision of Prof. Mo Li. I am fortunate to receive guidance from Prof. Mo Li both at HKUST and previously at NTU (as a research fellow from July 2023 to October 2023 and as a visiting student from May 2021 to September 2022). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. Li Lu. For more information, please refer to my CV.
